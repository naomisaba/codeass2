<h1> Mesh Blocks </h1>

G023 is a dataset from 2016 and it measures ‘relationship in household by age and by sex’. Mesh blocks are designed as such that they can be aggregated accurately to a vast range of spatial units and enable statistical comparison between geographical areas. <br><br><br><br><br>

  <h1> GO23 Data Usage </h1>
  <p> There are many Government departments which will be interested in the G023 data set. G023 Data set lists ‘relationship in household by age and by sex’, it investigates the structure of a household, whether the individuals present are living alone, married or in a partnership, whether that partnership is between 2 individuals of the same gender or opposite gender and whether they have children. It then categorises each by age. <br><br>
    Such information would be of importance to: <br>
    -	Department of Health would use the data to determine locations for public health centres, pharmaceutical stores, sport and recreation infrastructures, health promotion and disease prevention education among many. <br>
    -	Department of Employment work and family programs as well as labour marketing programs for people of working age, this data would be useful to determine working age. Also to determine Job Service locations. <br>
    -	Department of Education and training could use this data for the creation and development of research infrastructures, skills and vocational education programs, youth affairs and programs amongst many. This data is useful in that regard as it investigates household with kids of particular age group. <br>
    -	This information could also be useful to private market research teams looking to increase profit in different areas of the business sector. <br>
